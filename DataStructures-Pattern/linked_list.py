# Linked list is a datastruct which stored the data in a Node and link the next node .efficient for memory


# list [2|next] -> [3 | next] - > [4 | null]
# l1.next = l2  [ storing the adress of second node to first linked list]
# l3.next = None

#ptr = l1 [ ptr points to l1 or head
# ptr = ptr.next , ptr hops to next node

# we cannot lose the head pointer , all the data or next will be lose

# temp = head -> create a temp value that point to head
# temp = temp.next 

# time complexity - O(n), space complexity - O(1)
